### Dues

Most skaters pay their dues on PayPal. It's easier for them and they _do not_ pay a fee (we pay the fee). This is by far the preferred method for paying dues (over check or cash) because keeping track of that shit is a nightmare.

Reconciling PayPal dues transactions is super easy. Fury creates invoices in PayPal that will automatically match up to the correct PayPal payment. 

Example of an easy PayPal dues reconciliation:

You can ALWAYS hit the `OK` button in the middle of 2 transactions for PayPal fees. The note on the Bank Statement Line will look something like this:
```
Nov 6, 2018
PayPal (Related to 
6Y530235RP8342232)
Fee
```
and are currently $1.46.

Click `OK` on all of those fees and they'll disappear.

For Skater dues, look at the Bank Statement Line on the left. Look at name in the matching Transaction statement on the right. If they match up and the amounts match up (if the amounts match up, the entire thing will be shaded green), you can hit the `OK` button and the transaction will go away. Matzah is awesome and will be able to do these clear reconciliations for you.

### Other Transactions

Sometimes you'll come across transactions that aren't inherently obvious (they won't have a match).

**Here's an easy example:**

Take the following steps and refer to the screenshot below:
1. Fill out `Who`. Look at the Bank Line statement to see if it identifies a who. If it doesn't, [check who it's from]() and enter that. If it does, put that contact in.
2. Fill out the `What`. In this case, I knew what it should be filed under so I searched for `transaction` and chose `6440 - Bank Charges & Transaction Fees` from the options that were brought up. If you don't know what it's for, [check what it's for]().
3. Fill out the `Why`. This can be whatever you want, just write what it is. If you don't know what it's for, [check what it's for]() and write that in.
4. Once steps 1-3 are completed, an `OK` button will appear. Click it and the transaction will disappear.
